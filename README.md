Setting up the test environment
===================================

Running the system locally requires Node.js and socket.io. Once Node has been installed, navigate to the project directory and install socket.io with the node package manager ('npm install socket.io').

To run, execute 'node app.js' and navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser.
