	  	<h1>How to play Pai Gow</h1>

	  	<p>Pai Gow is similar to black jack in that all players compete against a single player. It differs however in that this player (the banker) is not always the dealer. All players have the opportunity to bank on their turn, but do not have it. The banker does not place a bet, but is responsible for paying out bets placed by the other players.</p>

	  	<p>The player at the top of the screen is the dealer, he is played by an AI and will always bet $5. The dealer will always bank on its turn. </p>

	  	<p>The amount of money each player has is displayed above their cards on the table, as well as on the top bar. Also on this top bar is their name, level, and experience</p>

	  	<p><b>Betting</b>
	  		The betting stage is when the player makes their bets against the banker. The banker does not place a bet. The player cannot bet more money than they have, or more than the banker is able to pay out.</p>

	  	<p><b>Pair selection</b>
	  		During this phase, players form two pairs of tiles, and high pair and a low pair. from the four they were dealt. These pairs are compared with the bankers high/low pairs in order to determine the winner. <br>
	  		When the player clicks on a tile, it is highlighted yellow to signify that it is selected. When exactly two tiles are selected, the value of the two pairs is displayed. The rules are very complicated, but it comes down to Pair>Wong>Gong>number. The goal is to maximize both values.
	  	</p>

	  	<p><b>Tile reveal</b>
	  		During this phase, all players tiles are revealed and the players winnings are calculated. Each players pairs are compared with the bankers. To win the round, your pairs must both be better than the banker's pairs. If you win one and lose one, the round is a push and no money changes hands.
	  	</p>

	  	<p><b>Leaving the game</b>
	  		Since this game is multiplayer, having a player leave mid game can cause problems. To solve this, we are forced to shut down the table. Please use the exit button and wait until the end of the round to leave, you will be automatically forwarded to an exit page
